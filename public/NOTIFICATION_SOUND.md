# Notification Sound

To add a notification sound:

1. Find a notification sound you like (e.g., from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) or [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/))
2. Save it as `notification.mp3` in this directory
3. The app will automatically play it when the notification appears

**Note**: Some browsers block autoplay audio. The sound may require user interaction first.

## Quick Option

You can use iOS notification sounds available online or record one from your iPhone.
