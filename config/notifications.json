We need to make sure all of this is done before your appointment so they have what they need to make the right treatment decision.\n\nPlease call me back once you've spoken to their office so I can start whichever process they prefer.\n\nSarah",

She's based at Emory, maybe a 45 mins drive from you?\n\nI can get you scheduled for after Christmas but that would mean more treatment delays. Do you want to wait or go with your current doc so you can get on those meds straight away?",
